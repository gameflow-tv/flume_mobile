# ðŸª„ Usage

## Theme data

To retrieve the theme object, use its inherited widget provider or the pre-made shorthand extensions;

```dart
// Retrieve inherited widget
final theme = Flume.of(context);

// .. or use the shorthand extension
final theme = context.theme;
```

## Ambiance

The ambiance system provides color schemes based on a seed color, and relies on an elevation system to provide contrast between UI elements.

For Material 3 users, the concept may not be too unfamiliar, however we rely heavily on elevation (think z-index) to compose beautiful UI with dynamic colors.

The elevation tree ranges from 0 (darkest) to 5 (lightest).

### How to use

First and foremost, provide an `Ambiance` widget with a seed color to generate the palette. If no color is provided, it defaults to `FlumeColors.secondary` from the theme. The `Ambiance` widget takes either a `child` or a `builder` property.

```dart
return Ambiance(
  // Seed color, defaults to `FlumeColors.secondary`
  color: Colors.red,
  builder: (context, ambiance) {
    // Use ambiance data provided by builder
    return Container(
      color: ambiance.color,
      child: Container(
        // Or retrieve ambiance from context,
        // alternatively Ambiance.of(context).color
        color: context.ambiance.color,
      ),
    );
  }
)
```

This will correspond to a single ambiance "layer". If we check out the elevation property from the example above, this will start at 0;

```dart
print(ambiance.elevation); // 0
```

However, if we stack Ambiance widgets in the tree, we also increase the elevation for each layer;

```dart
return Ambiance(
  builder: (context, ambiance1) {
    return Ambiance(
      builder: (context, ambiance2) {
        return Ambiance(
          builder: (context, ambiance3) {
            return null;
          },
        );
      },
    );
  },
);
```

Which will result in the following values;

```dart
print(ambiance1.elevation); // 0
print(ambiance2.elevation); // 1
print(ambiance3.elevation); // 2
print(ambiance1.color); // dark variant
print(ambiance2.color); // mediumDark variant
print(ambiance3.color); // medium variant
```

:::note
Many of the Flume UI components use this system to set its own background and foreground colors in order to reflects its place in the elevation tree.
:::

In order to retrieve a color for a specific elevation, we can use `ambiance.at(n)`;

```dart
return Container(
  color: context.ambiance.at(5) // light
);
```

We can also use the palette directly;

```dart
return Container(
  color: context.ambiance.palette.mediumDark // mediumDark
);
```

### Colors from images

At Gameflow, a teamâ€™s or tournamentâ€™s main logo is the basis for the color extraction algorithm to build a color scheme thatâ€™s applied to an entire UI or individual components that utilize dynamic color.

The goal is to give every team and tournament a distinct look, and to emphasize the uniqueness of each. Using ambiance results in a visually unified, refreshed and modern appearance whilst embracing the diversity of content and giving it visual context.

A single source color is used to derive five tones that provide the basis for any development use case. The dynamic color system is built using luminance. Meaning that if the hue and saturation were removed, we'd be able to see the contrast through shades. The colors ensure colorful and rich palettes while adhering to the WCAG color contrast guidelines.

:::info
Combining color based on tonality, rather than hex value or hue, is one of the key systems that make any color output accessible. Layouts using dynamic color will meet requirements because the algorithmic combinations that a user can experience are designed to meet accessibility standards.

### The ambiance palette

The Ambiance color algorithm generates five colors for each identity: _dark_, _mediumDark_, _medium_, _mediumLight_ and _light_. The colors represent different levels of elevation:

- _dark_ (elevation: 0) is used as the background-color on a page, and as text-color on light backgrounds.

- _mediumDark_ (elevation: 1) serves as background-color for elements that sit on top of _dark_.

- _medium_ (elevation: 2) is mostly used as hover state for _mediumDark_, or as background-color for elements that sit on top of _mediumDark_.

- _mediumLight_ (elevation: 3) is used as hover state for _medium_.

- _light_ (elevation: 4) is used for selected states, and generally as visual flourish to complement the overall color scheme of each identity.

Avoid stacking more than three layers on top of each other (not including hover states) as this will clutter the UI. Always make sure layers that are stacked on top of each other are distinguished using elevation in chronological order.
