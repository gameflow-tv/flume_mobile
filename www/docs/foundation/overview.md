# ðŸ“– Overview

Flume Foundation is the shared design foundation for Gameflow. This is where we keep things like color, type styles, motion, spacing and other design tokens.

It aims to create a recognisable and consistent user experience and speed up design development with common principles. These are things everyone should use â€” itâ€™s what makes Gameflow look like Gameflow.

All design tokens are gathered in a `FlumeTheme` class, and all design token classes are dead simple, as they only hold raw data.
