# ðŸ“– Overview

The components library is a set of Flutter widgets that implements components from the Flume design system. This is a library that very likely will change a lot until the first stable release, and the API surface _is_ unstable.

All components _require_ a `Flume` parent present in the tree, and most components also _require_ an `Ambiance` parent in the tree as well in order to use dynamic color palettes.
