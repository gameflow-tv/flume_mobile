# Overview

Flume is the shared design foundation for [Gameflow](https://gameflow.tv). This is where we keep things like color, type styles, motion, spacing, plus guidelines for writing and accessibility. It’s also where our design tokens live.

It aims to create a recognisable and consistent user experience and speed up design development with common principles. These are things everyone should use — it’s what makes Gameflow look like Gameflow.

Even though we at Gameflow use Flume to communicate our brand, the design system is flexible enough in its composition to accomodate for unique expressions. This is where configuration comes in play, where you can plug in your own custom design tokens; fonts, shapes, motion etc.
